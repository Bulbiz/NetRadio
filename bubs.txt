The entire world shall be seized! By me!
Once you're dead, I shall be the only Singularity around!
In the end, I'll have you bastards know what it truly means to be inside the circle of providence.
The end draws nigh...
All causality shall be bent!
Blasted small flies.
Let's put that strength to the test.
Disappear...
Fuhahahaha!
Eat this!
Oh, wings!
Mince them, wings of chaos!
Shall I put on a show then?	
The advent of the king of all creations is here!
Blasted small flies... I'll exterminate the lot of you.
Playtime's over...
This immortality-severing power, let's have your body a taste of it!
Be swallowed in the darkness of chaos.... Chaos Legion!
Be dyed in black and return to nothingness!
My plan... for it to be undone here...!
